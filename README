DEPENDENCIES:
  - GCC and binutils
  - GNU Bash
  - PaX Utilities

USAGE:
  See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/genkernel.xml or
  issue ``genkernel --help''.

PORTING:
  To port to other arches:

  # cd /usr/share/genkernel
  # cp -Rp x86 ${myarch}
  # mkdir /usr/share/genkernel/pkg/${myarch}

  Modify what is needed in the /usr/share/genkernel/${myarch}
  directory, as well making a generic kernel-config.

IMPORTANT KERNEL NOTES:
  - You MUST have /dev/pts turned on.
  - To boot genkernel properly, the kernel config must have
    Initial RAM disk support.

BOOTING A KERNEL WITH INITRD:

  GRUB:
    root=	needs to point to your root partition
    vga=	should be the resolution you want your screen. 0x317 is
    		1024x768 - 16bpp and you'll get a pretty splash if
    		configured properly

  GRUB EXAMPLE ENTRY:
    title=2.6.0 [ Genkernel ]
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-2.6.0-gentoo root=/dev/hda3 vga=0x317
    initrd (hd0,0)/boot/initrd-2.6.0-gentoo
